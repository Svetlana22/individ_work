CSS information can be provided from various sources. CSS style information can 
be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple 
style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the 
output device being used; for example, the screen version can be quite different 
from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.
Priority scheme for CSS sources (from highest to lowest priority):
 
 * Author styles (provided by the web page author), in the form of:
 
 * Inline styles, inside the HTML document, style information on a single element, specified using the style attribute
 
 * Embedded style, blocks of CSS information inside the HTML itself
 
 * External style sheets, i.e., a separate CSS file referenced from the document

 User style:
 
 * A local CSS file the user specifies with a browser option, which acts as an override applied to all documents
 
 * User agent style
 
 * Default styles applied by the user agent, i.e., the browser's default settings for each element's presentation
