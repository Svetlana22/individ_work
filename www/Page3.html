Because not all browsers correctly parse CSS code, developed coding techniques known 
as CSS hacks can either filter specific browsers or target specific browsers (generally 
both are known as CSS filters). The former can be defined as CSS filtering hacks and 
the latter can be defined as CSS targeting hacks. Both can be used to hide or show 
parts of the CSS to different browsers. This is achieved either by exploiting CSS-handling 
quirks or bugs in the browser, or by taking advantage of lack of support for parts 
of the CSS specifications. Using CSS filters, some designers have gone as 
far as delivering different CSS to certain browsers to ensure designs render as expected. 
Because very early web browsers were either completely incapable of handling CSS, or rendered 
CSS very poorly, designers today often routinely use CSS filters that completely prevent these 
browsers from accessing any of the CSS. Internet Explorer support for CSS began with IE 3.0 and 
increased progressively with each version. By 2008, the first Beta of Internet Explorer 8 offered 
support for CSS 2.1 in its best web standards mode.

An example of a well-known CSS browser bug is the Internet Explorer box model bug, where box widths 
are interpreted incorrectly in several versions of the browser, resulting in blocks that are too 
narrow when viewed in Internet Explorer, but correct in standards-compliant browsers. The bug can 
be avoided in Internet Explorer 6 by using the correct doctype in (X)HTML documents. CSS hacks and 
CSS filters are used to compensate for bugs such as this, just one of hundreds of CSS bugs that have 
been documented in various versions of Netscape, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer 
(including Internet Explorer 7).
