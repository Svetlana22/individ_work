The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3 
was released in that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. But it was more 
than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the 
specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000, was 
the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS 1 support,
 surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support 15 months earlier. 
 Other browsers followed soon afterwards, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2. 
 As of August 2010, no (finished) browser has fully implemented CSS 2, with implementation levels 
 varying (see Comparison of layout engines (CSS)).

Even though early browsers such as Internet Explorer 3 and 4, and Netscape 4.x had support for CSS, 
it was typically incomplete and had serious bugs. This was a serious obstacle for the adoption of CSS.

When later 'version 5' browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, 
they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs 
and other quirks. The proliferation of such CSS-related inconsistencies and even the variation 
in feature support has made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across 
browsers and platforms. Some authors resorted to workarounds such as CSS hacks and CSS filters.
